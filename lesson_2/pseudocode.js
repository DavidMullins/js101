/* 
*** A function that returns the sum of two numbers
***

- Create a function with 2 parameters, num1 and num2.

- Veryify num1 is of type Number
--  If not, attempt to coerce it to an integer and re-verify.
--- If num1 is still not an interger, return statement as such to user.

- Veryify num2 is of type Number
-- If not, attempt to coerce it to an integer and re-verify.
--- If num2 is still not an interger, return statement as such to user.

- Within the body, return num1 + num2



*** A function that takes an array of strings, and returns a string
that is all those strings concatenated together
***

- Create a fucntion that takes an array as a parameter

- Verify the arguemement passed into the function is an array of strings

- create an empty string variable with let

- loop through array and on each iteration add the element to the empty string
array. make sure to concat

- after looping return the string variable you added to



*** A method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with
every other element from the original array, starting with the first element.
***

- Create a fucntion that takes an array as a parameter

- Verify the arguemement passed into the function is an array of numbers

- create an empty array variable

- loop through array starting with index 0 and add the element to the new 
array variable created. += 2 for iteration. repeat.

- after looping return the array variable you added to



*** A function that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a given
character in a string.
***

- create a fucntion that takes 2 parameters, a string, and a character

- intialize a counting variable to 0

- intialize an index variable to 0

- loop though string starting at its index of 0
-- each loop check IF the string at index of the loop is equal to the character arguement passed
-- if so, add to the count 1
-- after adding to count, check if count is 3
--- if so, set index variable from earlier to the index of current point in loop and break
out of loop
- finally, return the index variable



*** A function that takes two arrays of numbers and returns the result of
merging the arrays.
*** 

- create a fucntion that takes 2 arrays as parameters

- verify both arrays are of numbers

- return array1.concat(array2)
