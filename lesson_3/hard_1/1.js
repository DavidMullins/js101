/*
No, in the first one, on line 3 it uses a , instead of a ;

This means it will have a second key:value of undefined : undefined


Got this one wrong.

"The function first() returns the expected value of { prop1: "hi there" }, 
but second() returns undefined"

"In second, JavaScript inserts a semicolon after the word return, so the
function returns undefined. "
